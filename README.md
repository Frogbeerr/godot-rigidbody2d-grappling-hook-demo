This is a small demo project written in Godot.

It demonstrates one way of implementing a 2D grappling hook mechanic applied to a RigidBody2D.

Controls are as follows: 
Left-Click, to fire your grappling hook. You will be pulled in by default.
Space, to stopp being pulled in. The rope stiffens up and your distance to your anchor stays (more or less) constant.
